        Thanks for using my app Gua!\n
        \n
        Since the official Academic Affairs System of Sun Yat-sen University (as well as
        wjw.sysu.edu.cn, which is official now) uses geetest to prevent bot, it is difficult to
        create any client by parsing HTML and making HTTP requests. By accident, I found that cookie
        can be retrieved from WebView widget on Android. This is how this app works.\n
        \n
        To get your new score push message, click the "Play" FAB at right bottom corner, and login
        to wjw.sysu.edu.cn successfully. After that, click the Tick on the Toolbar above and you are
        ready to be anxious!\n
        \n
        To keep the cookie alive while reducing battery drain, your cookie is uploaded to the app
        server and the server requests for your scores on behalf of you, once 25 minutes. The server
        will never do any things other than getting your scores data.\n
        \n
        To use this app, it means that you\'ve learn about the claim above and use it with you own
        risk.
